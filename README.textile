h1. Dirt Readme

Dirt is a reporting frontend to Best Practical ["Request Tracker":http://bestpractical.com/rt/]. It was written to facilitate my work at ["Directi":http://www.directi.com], who kindly let me work on it during regular working hours.

h3. Features

* An arbitrary number of dashboards
* A wiki for documentation
* Tabular reports 
* Prettier than RT (IMO)
* ... more to come (see ["TODO.textile":docs/TODO.textile])

h3. Installation

Installation is still pretty clunky:	

* Clone the source
* Install Ruby 1.9.3 if you don't already have it. Using ["rvm":https://rvm.io] for this is highly recommended.
* Run @bundle install@ to fetch dependencies. Using rvm's gemsets feature to isolate these dependencies is a good idea.
* Copy @config/database.yml.sample@ to @config/database.yml@ and edit. Note that there are *two* database configurations:
** @rt@ : Your existing Request Tracker database. With the current featureset this can be read-only access. This will change with later releases.
** @dirt@ : A new empty database that you have created for dirt.
* Run @RACK_ENV='production' rake db:migrate@ to create the dirt schema. Ensure the @RACK_ENV@ environment has been defined in database.yml.
* Run @cd db; ruby create_views.rb < mapping.json > create-views.sql@
* Review @create-views.sql@ -- TL;DR It creates a few views so we have a schema that is ORM friendly and to make report queries more intuitive. 
* Run @create-views.sql@ against your RT database. Consult your RDBMS documentation to find out how to do this. *Note:* @create-views.sql@ uses MySQL's dialect of SQL.
* Run: @RACK_ENV=<env> ruby application.rb@. Ruby rack integration is currently broken.

h3. Using Dirt

* Navigate to http://your.host.name
* Add a project
* Use ["textile":http://redcloth.org/textile] syntax to add text content to the page.

h4. Table Macro

* Add a query using the following syntax:

<pre>
<~
{
  "type": "table",
  "sql":"SELECT COUNT(id) AS Count, Owner AS Name FROM expanded_tickets WHERE Queue = 'linux-hosting' AND Status IN('new', 'open', 'stalled') GROUP BY Owner",
  "caption": "Ticket Ownership"
}
~>
</pre>

p. Any arbitrary SQL statement querying the 'expanded_tickets' view can be used to report on tickets.

h4. Aging Macro

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
  "type": "aging",
  "queues":["linux-hosting", "linux-hosting-issues"],
  "caption": "Ticket Aging"
}
~>
</pre>

p. Note that queues *must* be passed an Array, even if it is a single item array.

h4. Simple Taskboard Macro

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
  "type":"simple_task_board",
  "caption":"Taskboard",
  "group_by":"Status",
  "group_sequence":["new","open","stalled"],
  "ticket_selector":"Queue = 'linux-hosting'",
  "resolved_after":"1 week ago"
}
~>
</pre>

h4. Kanban Taskboard Macro

* Each column in a row must be added as an array element
* To add sub columns pass an array of array elements with the parent column name
* Add a query using the following syntax:

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
"type":"kanban_task_board",
"caption":"Taskboard",
"group_sequence":[
  [ ["spec1"] ],
  [ ["spec2"], ["spec3"] ],
  [ ["spec4"], ["spec5"], ["spec6"] ],
  [ ["spec7", [ ["subspec1"], ["subspec2"], ["subspec3"] ] ] ],
  [ ["spec8"], ["spec9", [ ["subspec1"], ["subspec2"], ["subspec3"] ] ], ["spec10"] ]
  ],
"queues":["linux-hosting","linux-hosting-issues","vps-hosting", "vps-hosting-issues"],
"resolved_after":"last week monday"
}
~>
</pre>

p. Note that queues *must* be passed an Array, even if it is a single item array.


h4. Pie Chart Macro

* The group by column comes first in the SQL statement
* The data column follows the group column
* If more than one data column in received, only the 1st data column is used to generate the graph

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
"type":"pie_chart",
"caption":"Piechart Caption",
"sql": "SELECT Owner AS Name, COUNT(id) AS Count  FROM expanded_tickets WHERE Queue IN('linux-hosting', 'linux-hosting-issues', 'vps-hosting', 'vps-hosting-issues') AND Status IN('new','open','stalled') GROUP BY Owner"
}
~>
</pre>

h4. Bar Chart Macro

* The group by column comes first in the SQL statement
* The data column follows the group column
* More than one data column can be plotted if 'group-sequence' is defined

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
"type":"bar_chart",
"direction":"vertical",
"caption":"Barchart Caption",
"sql":"SELECT Owner AS Name, COUNT(id) AS Count, %AVG_DAYS_SINCE(Created), %AVG_DAYS_SINCE(LastUpdated) FROM expanded_tickets WHERE Queue IN('linux-hosting', 'linux-hosting-issues', 'vps-hosting', 'vps-hosting-issues') AND Status IN('new','open','stalled') GROUP BY Owner",
"source":"source of the data",
"group-sequence": [ "count" , "avg days (created)", "avg days (updated)" ] ,
"y-text":"some y-text"
}
~>
</pre>

h4. Line Chart Macro

* The group by column comes first in the SQL statement
* The data column follows the group column
* If more than one data column in received, only the 1st data column is used to generate the graph
* *Tip:* Frequence graph can obtained by ordering according to the data column

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
"type":"line_chart",
"caption":"Linechart Caption",
"sql":"SELECT COUNT(id) AS Count, %AVG_DAYS_SINCE(Created)  FROM expanded_tickets WHERE Queue IN('linux-hosting', 'linux-hosting-issues', 'vps-hosting', 'vps-hosting-issues') AND Status IN('new','open','stalled') GROUP BY Owner ORDER BY AVG_DAYS_SINCE_CREATED",
"group-sequence": [ "count" ] ,
"y-text":"some y-text"
}
~>
</pre>

h4. SQL Interpolation

In most places where you provide an complete or partial SQL statement as a parameter to a macro you can use the following macros to simplify things. Note that the macros are case sensitive.

h5. %DATE()

SQL Statements typically expect static dates:

@SELECT * FROM expanded_tickets WHERE LastUpdated > '2012-08-15'@ 

But for a dashboard you'll typically need a relative date. To answer the question, "show me a list of tickets updated in the last week" you can do this:

@SELECT * FROM expanded_tickets WHERE LastUpdated > %DATE(last week)@ 

You can write stuff like:

* last week
* yesterday
* last week thursday
* 4 o'clock last monday

Dirt uses the ["Chronic":https://github.com/mojombo/chronic] gem to parse these description. See ["Chronic's examples":https://github.com/mojombo/chronic#examples] for a complete listing.

h5. %AVG_DAYS_SINCE()

Calculate the average number of days since a date field. Example:

@SELECT Owner, %AVG_DAYS_SINCE(Created) FROM expanded_tickets GROUP BY Owner@

to tabulate the average age of tickets per user.
