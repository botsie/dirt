h4. Pie Chart Macro

* The group by column comes first in the SQL statement
* The data column follows the group column
* If more than one data column in received, only the 1st data column is used to generate the graph

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
"type":"pie_chart",
"caption":"Piechart Caption",
"sql": "SELECT Owner AS Name, COUNT(id) AS Count  FROM expanded_tickets WHERE Queue IN('linux-hosting', 'linux-hosting-issues', 'vps-hosting', 'vps-hosting-issues') AND Status IN('new','open','stalled') GROUP BY Owner"
}
~>
</pre>
