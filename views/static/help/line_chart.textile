h4. Line Chart Macro

* The group by column comes first in the SQL statement
* The data column follows the group column
* If more than one data column in received, only the 1st data column is used to generate the graph
* *Tip:* Frequence graph can obtained by ordering according to the data column

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
"type":"line_chart",
"caption":"Linechart Caption",
"sql":"SELECT COUNT(id) AS Count, %AVG_DAYS_SINCE(Created)  FROM expanded_tickets WHERE Queue IN('linux-hosting', 'linux-hosting-issues', 'vps-hosting', 'vps-hosting-issues') AND Status IN('new','open','stalled') GROUP BY Owner ORDER BY AVG_DAYS_SINCE_CREATED",
"group-sequence": [ "count" ] ,
"y-text":"some y-text"
}
~>
</pre>
