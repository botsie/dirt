h4. Kanban Taskboard

* Kanban taskboard should be configured on the project settings page
* The group_sequence key controls the layout of the Kanban board. It is an array of rows.
* Each column in a row must be added as an array element
* To add sub columns pass an array of array elements with the parent column name
* Add a query using the following syntax:

p. Example:

{
"group_sequence":[
  [["To Do"], ["Doing"], ["Done"] ],
  [["Blocked"]]
  ],
"queues":["linux-hosting","linux-hosting-issues","vps-hosting", "vps-hosting-issues"],
"resolved_after":"last week monday"
}

p. A more contrived example illustrates sub-columns:

{
"group_sequence":[
  [ ["spec1"] ],
  [ ["spec2"], ["spec3"] ],
  [ ["spec4"], ["spec5"], ["spec6"] ],
  [ ["spec7", [ ["subspec1"], ["subspec2"], ["subspec3"] ] ] ],
  [ ["spec8"], ["spec9", [ ["subspec1"], ["subspec2"], ["subspec3"] ] ], ["spec10"] ]
"queues":["linux-hosting","linux-hosting-issues","vps-hosting", "vps-hosting-issues"],
"resolved_after":"last week monday"
}

p. Note that queues *must* be passed an Array, even if it is a single item array.
