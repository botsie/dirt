h4. Bar Chart Macro

p. Bar Chart Macro can be used to add a dynamic bar chart on a page

* The group by column comes first in the SQL statement
* The data column follows the group column
* More than one data column can be plotted if 'group-sequence' is defined

Example:

<pre>
<~
{
"type":"bar_chart",
"direction":"vertical",
"caption":"Barchart Caption",
"sql":"SELECT Owner AS Name, COUNT(id) AS Count, %AVG_DAYS_SINCE(Created), %AVG_DAYS_SINCE(LastUpdated) FROM expanded_tickets WHERE Queue IN('linux-hosting', 'linux-hosting-issues', 'vps-hosting', 'vps-hosting-issues') AND Status IN('new','open','stalled') GROUP BY Owner",
"source":"source of the data",
"group-sequence": [ "count" , "avg days (created)", "avg days (updated)" ] ,
"y-text":"some y-text"
}
~>
</pre>
