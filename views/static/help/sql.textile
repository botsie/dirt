h4. SQL Interpolation

In most places where you provide an complete or partial SQL statement as a parameter to a macro you can use the following macros to simplify things. Note that the macros are case sensitive.

h5. %DATE()

SQL Statements typically expect static dates:

@SELECT * FROM expanded_tickets WHERE LastUpdated > '2012-08-15'@ 

But for a dashboard you'll typically need a relative date. To answer the question, "show me a list of tickets updated in the last week" you can do this:

@SELECT * FROM expanded_tickets WHERE LastUpdated > %DATE(last week)@ 

You can write stuff like:

* last week
* yesterday
* last week thursday
* 4 o'clock last monday

Dirt uses the ["Chronic":https://github.com/mojombo/chronic] gem to parse these description. See ["Chronic's examples":https://github.com/mojombo/chronic#examples] for a complete listing.

h5. %AVG_DAYS_SINCE()

Calculate the average number of days since a date field. Example:

@SELECT Owner, %AVG_DAYS_SINCE(Created) FROM expanded_tickets GROUP BY Owner@

to tabulate the average age of tickets per user.
