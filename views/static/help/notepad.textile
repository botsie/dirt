h4. Notepad

Notepad can be used to create RT tickets on the fly.
Owners can also be assigned to the newly created tickets.

h5. Syntax:

h6. Creating a ticket

* The number of stars in front of the subject defines the heirarchy of the ticket
* The owner is defined by adding @ and the owner name. Eg. @biju.ch
* Currently Notepad supports a heirarchy of 3 (ie. max 3 stars)

h6. Adding a comment

* Add a comment by including a hyphen '-'
* The comment message is added to ticket which preceeds the comment line
* After successful creation of the ticket a mail is sent to all the people concerned.

Example: 

<pre>
* Ticket Subject @owner.id
- Comment on the ticket
** Child Ticket Subject @owner.id
- Comment on child ticket
*** Grandchild ticket subject @owner.id
- Comment on Grand child
</pre>
